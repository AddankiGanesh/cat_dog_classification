# Cats and Dogs Classification Using Machine Learning

Implementation of support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

Project Description: Using the Kaggle dataset to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to develop a robust image classification model that can distinguish between these two groups.

Knowledge gained:

Image Classification: Learn how to use machine learning to create image classification models.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): An SVM that can perform efficient and effective binary classification function.

Data Preprocessing: Improve capabilities to prepare image data for machine learning, including resizing, normalization, and dataset segmentation.

Model Evaluation: Learn how to use basic metrics to evaluate model performance and interpret results for image classification.

Kaggle dataset: Learn real data on Kaggle construction and get a deep understanding of the issues and precautions in making datasets.
